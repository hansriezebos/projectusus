= Details =

== Dependencies ==

You first need !EclEmma, the code coverage tool. Point your Eclipse Update Manager to http://update.eclemma.org/

== Install Usus ==

The update site for Usus is http://projectusus.googlecode.com/svn/updates/

== Install Usus Dependency Graph Feature ==

To get visualizations for class dependencies and cyclic package dependencies, you need to install Zest along with Usus.  Zest is available from the [http://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse_Project_Update_Sites Eclipse release update site] corresponding to your Eclipse installation. This update site is enabled by default, i.e. Eclipse will find Zest automatically, the required Zest features do not have to be selected manually.
