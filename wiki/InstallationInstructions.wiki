To get visualizations for class dependencies and cyclic package dependencies, you need to install Zest along with Usus.  Zest is available from the [http://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse_Project_Update_Sites Eclipse release update site] corresponding to your Eclipse installation. This update site is enabled by default, i.e. Eclipse will find Zest automatically, the required Zest features do not have to be selected manually.
