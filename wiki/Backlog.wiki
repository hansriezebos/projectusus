#summary Our plans for the future of Usus development.

= The Usus Backlog =

  * LCOM-Metric and visualization:
    * Invocation of a method from another method
    * Access to a field from a method
    * Visualization: Inside one class / crossing a class boundary
  * Hotspot-list for LCOC (relative / absolute): 
    * How many unconnected groups of classes does a package contain? 
  * Try out ZEST 2.x and include it if it works well
  * Implement Big Ball of Mud metrics
  * Let the class / package graphs display the hotspots of the selected metric (by some kind of visual emphasis)
  * Determine the "thickness" of a connection between two packages / classes / methods - visualization?
  * Determine which edges of a cycle can be removed in order to resolve the cycle (this seems to be the minimum feedback arc set problem: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback_arc_set ) - visualization?
