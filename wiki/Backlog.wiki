#summary Our plans for the future of Usus development.

= The Usus Backlog =

  * (+++) LCOM-Metric and visualization: (http://docs.codehaus.org/display/SONAR/LCOM4+-+Lack+of+Cohesion+of+Methods)
    * Invocation of a method from another method
    * Access to a field from a method
    * Visualization: Inside one class / crossing a class boundary
  * LCOC-metric (relative / absolute): (same as LCOM, but for classes)
    * How many unconnected groups of classes does a package contain?
    * (+) Implement a Hotspot-list for it (vizualisation already works via Spring layout)
  * (++) Try out ZEST 2.x and include it if it works well (http://wiki.eclipse.org/Zest)
  * (++) Let the class / package graphs display the hotspots of the selected metric (by some kind of visual emphasis)
  * (++) Determine the "thickness" of a connection between two packages / classes / methods
  * (++) Visualization of the above
  * (++) Determine which edges of a cycle can be removed in order to resolve the cycle (this seems to be the minimum feedback arc set problem: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback_arc_set )
  * (+++) Visualization of the above
  * (++) Implement the metric "Distance from the Main Sequence" described in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_package_metrics
