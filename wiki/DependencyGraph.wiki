#Shows a dependency graph of the classes

= What's it about? =

Click the refresh button in the dependency graph to show all classes of the system.
In most cases the graph of the system will be very big.
You can also move the classes in the view with drag and drop.
If you click a second time on the refresh button, the graph will be repainted with another random layout.

In order to find classes with lots of dependcies just increase the treshold.
With a bigger treshhold the size of the graph will be much smaller and faster.
You can increase the treshhold in the upper left of the dependency graph view.
