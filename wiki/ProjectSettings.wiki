#summary Apply common settings and transfer them from one project to another with ease

= What's it about? =

Projects in the Eclipse workspace can comprise many specific settings: compiler warnings, !CheckStyle settings, editor save actions, code formatting rules, and so on. Applying these settings selectively to a project makes sense (they are stored in the project itself and thus under version control; you can change them selectively for individual projects). But then you have to do a lot of manual work on the project settings dialogs. The *Project Settings* feature in Usus makes this task much more convenient.
