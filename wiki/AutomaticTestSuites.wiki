#summary Easily run all unit tests in multiple projects with a single click

= What's it about? =

In software projects with sizeable code bases maintaining the suite of all unit tests regularly becomes an issue: developers want to be able to execute the entire collection of tests with a single command, but an AllTests suite that lists the test cases explicitly must be kept manually, which is inefficient and error-prone.

The Eclipse IDE allows to run all tests in a single Java project or source folder directly from the context menu, but doesn't extend this functionality to multiple projects or even the entire workspace.

= How to use it? =

Usus provides a multi-project JUnit runner that lets you run all unit tests in
  # the projects you have selected (if the projects are not totally unrelated), or
  # all projects the currently selected project depends upon.

To use it, go to the Package Explorer and select
  # the desired projects and choose "Run As > JUnit Test", or
  # the root project and choose "Run As > All Tests Suite (JUnit)".
