Once upon a time... in an IT office somewhere...

Leif typing, enter Marc.
Leif: Hi Marc.
Marc: Hi Leif.
Leif: (mishears as 'High Life?') No, just project work.
Marc: What are you working on?
Leif: Yeah, we're building this new application, you know ... we've just started. And this 
      time, we'll do it right, test cases and so on. See, I've started with the central model 
      classes here, and I've already written one unit test.
Marc: Good.
Leif: Let's see ...
Both: GREEN!
Leif: Ok, watch it! Now I'll do another one.
      (Writes unit test, runs it.)
Both: GREEN!
Leif: Cool. Now I've got two. ... Wait. Suppose I have many of them. Say, a hundred. Is there
      a way to run them all at once?
Marc: Yes. There are suites.
      (Explains test suites - explicit AllTests)

A couple of hours later... at the coffee machine...

Marc: So, how many test cases do you have now?
Leif: Sixteen.
Marc: Wow.
Leif: And they're all in the test suite. And I run the suite all the time. ... Wait. I just
      _did_ run the test suite. It was green.
Marc: Ok. But that's good, isn't it?
Leif: Yeah, but thinking of it, it shouldn't. I've just changed the code (I did a new unit test
      of course). But I think one of the older test cases should be red now.  
      (Silence.)
Leif: Damn!
Marc: You forgot to add it to the test suite.
Leif: Yupp.
Marc: Happens easily.
Leif: Hm. But that's bad.
Marc: You can avoid that problem in Eclipse.
      (Explain right-click/Run As on project or source folder)
Leif: Cool. Let's go over to my computer and try it out.
      (Run the suite ... red.)
      See? I've got to rewrite that test case. ... Now.
Both: GREEN!
Leif: Cool. Then I can throw away the explicit AllTests suite.

The next day... early in the morning... (quite untypical for software developers...)
Leif: Morning.
Marc: Morning.
Leif: Look here, great progress. We got the server-side bundles up and running, and now
      I'm going to start with the RCP client.
Marc: Already something to see?
Leif: A little. I also have some test cases. Btw, perhaps you can help me with this. I
      have a couple of projects now (of course, the code is in different bundles :-).
      But Eclipse won't let me run all the test cases. If I right-click a single project,
      it works and collects them all. But when I select multiple projects, it's always
      grayed-out. How can I do this?
Marc: You can't.
Leif: Shit.
Marc: There's good reasons for it, of course.
Leif: Ok. Let's do the theory later. What am I going to do now?
Marc: Hm. You could try the ClasspathSuite.
      (Explains.)
Leif: Interesting. Let's try it out.
      (They run it.)
Both: GREEN!

A couple of days later... It's a rainy day, wind's howling...
Leif: Aaargh!
Marc: What's wrong?
Leif: Waiting, waiting, waiting. Takes ages! ... Ages! And then... ha! That NPE again! Argh!
Marc: And what takes it so long?
Leif: (Calmer.) Don't know. It all went so well for a while. But then we got more and more
      code...
Marc: ... and more and more test cases...
Leif: ... and more and more test cases, and it all got slower and slower. Argh!

TODO
Possibly switch over from dialogue to background explanation talk here? Or should we play out
the explanation for why it is slow in the dialogue?
