Overall time: 60' (45' speaking time, 15' Q&A)

- Dialogue:     complications in organizing test cases  15'
  - single test case
  - multiple test cases                -> explicit AllTests
  - must be maintained, error-prone    -> Run As on src/
  - multiple projects                  -> ClasspathSuite
  - slowness on large WS, static inits -> ? 
- Presentation: background                              10'
- Presentation: solution to the problem (in Usus)       10'
  - demo of suite
  - explain how it works
  - (say something about coverage -> need to make this
    work first)

Options for more material:
- explain about categories (no longer need name filters with
  pattern matching to exclude long-running test cases or test
  cases which require external system setup)
  -> need to work this into the auto test suite
- Running all tests as PDE tests?
