USUS Stories

1) As user, I want to have the common USUS (compiler settings, save actions, 
   checkstyle etc.) applied to any new Java project when I create it
   - so that I don't have to apply the settings manually every time.

2) As USUS-Developer, I want to be able to use USUS for USUS development
   - so that I experience myself how well it does (eat your own dogfood)

3) As user, I want to promote settings (compiler warnings, local checkstyle 
   config, ...) from one project to another
   - so that I don't have to make the settings on the Properties dialog for 
   each project.
