# What's it about? #

Many projects introduce the 'No Yellow' rule: we want zero tolerance for warnings (yellow markers in the workspace). Of course, this helps only if compiler warnings, checkstyle warnings etc. are actually switched on. To highlight the current status the usus is to use **YellowCount**. It displays the count, and gets more and more yellow when it increases.

# How to use it? #

Window > Show View > (Other) > Project USUS > YellowCount

Make sure you have it in some corner of the screen and constantly visible.
